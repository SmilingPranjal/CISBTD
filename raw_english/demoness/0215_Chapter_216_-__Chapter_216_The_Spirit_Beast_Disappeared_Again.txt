Chapter 216: The Spirit Beast Disappeared Again
Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
At the Cliff of Broken Hearts, Jiang Hao stopped by a large tree. It wasn’t far from his master’s residence. But as soon as he arrived, the sense of being targeted by a terrifying power disappeared.
When he looked up, he noticed flashes of lightning in the sky. If his guess was correct, someone had engaged with the person who had come after him.
Before long, the thunder in the sky began to dissipate, and the sense of danger was gone.
‘It’s over?’ Jiang Hao found it hard to believe.
Perhaps, in the eyes of others, it was just thunder in the sky. But he knew that the person who had come after him must have been very powerful, especially since they had locked on to him from the beginning. His strength would have made no difference if the enemy had attacked him.
‘The gap in strength is too big. I need to find a way to become stronger as soon as possible,’ Jiang Hao thought.
He stayed rooted to the place for half a day before heading to the Spirit Herb Garden.
Three days later, Jiang Hao still didn’t sense any danger or hear any news about the terrifying encounter. The Heavenly Note Sect paid no attention to it. Even those at the stone tablet were quiet. Everything felt like an illusion.
Now that things had returned to normal, he waited patiently for either the Heavenly Note Sect or Dan Yuan to say something about the incident.
Jiang Hao found Cheng Chou in the Spirit Herb Garden.
“Senior Brother Jiang?” Cheng Chou seemed excited, but he quickly restrained himself.
“Let’s go to your house. I will help you advance to the Foundation Establishment Realm,” Jiang Hao said calmly. With his current cultivation at the early stage of the Primordial Spirit Realm, it was not difficult for him to assist someone in the ninth stage of the Lifeblood Refinement Realm to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm.
Cheng Chou suppressed his excitement and nodded.
In a small courtyard, Cheng Chou sat cross-legged and circulated his Heavenly Sound Hundred Revolutions technique. Jiang Hao watched him and occasionally gave instructions.
“Your mind is a bit restless, and it’s causing the Hundred Sounds in your body to fail to resonate,” Jiang Hao commented. He waited for Cheng Chou to calm down.
After a long time, Jiang Hao saw that Cheng Chou’s aura had stabilized, his power was balanced, and the Hundred Sounds had reached the most harmonious state.
“Not bad,” Jiang Hao said. With Cheng Chou’s talent, achieving such a balance in the Hundred Sounds was indeed commendable.
After waiting for some time, Jiang Hao said, “Open your mouth.”
Whoosh!
A pill flew into Cheng Chou’s mouth. The pill’s power immediately disrupted the balance of his cultivation.
“Don’t worry too much. Maintain the previous power balance and feel the changes in your body. No need to worry,” Jiang Hao reassured him. The immense power caused Cheng Chou to feel pain, but he gritted his teeth and continued to maintain the previous balance of his power.
In his view, he was lucky. He had a senior who was guiding him. It was an advantage that the others didn’t have. This also meant that his success rate was higher than the others.
After a long time, he felt the pain starting to fade away. His body was filled with a completely new strength, far beyond what he had imagined. He couldn’t have dreamed that he would possess such a level of power.
His advancement to the Foundation Establishment Realm was successful!
When he woke up, he realized that the sky had already darkened and Jiang Hao was no longer by his side.
He was filled with gratitude. As he stepped out, he saw two people standing at the door. It was Senior Brother Mu Qi, whom he occasionally met in the Spirit Herb Garden, and Senior Sister Miao Tinglian.
“Senior Brother Mu… Senior Sister Miao, greeting.” He bowed to them.
“I told you he would reach the Foundation Establishment Realm,” said Miao Tinglian with a smile.
“Indeed,” said Mu Qi with a friendly smile. ‘You are Junior Brother Cheng Chou, right? The one who works at the Spirit Herb Garden?”
“Yes,” Cheng Chou said as he bowed his head.
“We discovered that you were advancing to the Foundation Establishment
Realm, ” said Mu Qi. “Do you want to come with us to meet the Cliff Master?”
Since he had advanced to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he would become an inner sect disciple. They headed to Ku Wu Chang’s house.
“Are you saying you want to continue working in the Spirit Herb Garden, just as you did as an outer sect disciple under Jiang Hao’s supervision?” Ku Wu Chang asked.
“Yes,” Cheng Chou said as he knelt on the ground.
“Junior Brother Cheng wants to continue doing what he did before as an outer sect disciple without interfering with Junior Brother Jiang’s duties,” Mu Qi explained.
Many people in the Cliff of Broken Hearts knew that Jiang Hao liked to stay in the Spirit Herb Garden. Although others were not familiar with Jiang Hao, no one competed with him. However, since the long-term guardianship of the Spirit Herb Garden only required one inner sect disciple, an additional person needed to be approved.
Ku Wu Chang looked at Cheng Chou indifferently. “You often take care of Xiao Li. Is that correct?”
“Yes.”
“Continue doing that.”
“Then I will take Junior Brother Cheng to find a new place to live,” said Mu Qi.
As for Xiao Li, he had occasionally heard Miao Tinglian mention her. If what she said was true, Xiao Li could be the next True Disciple.
After confirming that Cheng Chou had advanced successfully, Jiang Hao went to the market to sell talismans. While setting up his stall, he encountered the client from before.
“Didn’t you say you didn’t have the Hundred Thousand Swords Talisman last time? You made it sound as though that was a temporary issue. You still don’t have it today. Remember not to brag so much next time.”
In the end, he bought all the talismans again.
Jiang Hao had enough spirit stones to buy a second batch of silver moon petals. However, it was barely enough.
The next day, Cheng Chou informed him that he could continue working in the Spirit Herb Garden.
He also mentioned that the Cliff Master had mentioned Xiao Li.
Jiang Hao didn’t find that surprising. It was inevitable for others to find out about Xiao Li’s unique capabilities.
Since the Cliff Master had no intention of intervening, that was fine.
What surprised Jiang Hao was that Cheng Chou had chosen to stay in the Spirit Herb Garden. Although having a helper would make things much easier for Jiang Hao, people usually strove for higher status and positions. One should always aim high.
He had thought Cheng Chou would have left the Spirit Herb Garden after advancing to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Jiang Hao had to admit that it was good to have Cheng Chou around.
Jiang Hao suddenly realized that, with Cheng Chou around, he might be driven to the mines one day. That wouldn’t be bad, either.
Three days later, Xiao Li appeared in front of Jiang Hao. She was full of excitement. She had already reached the fourth stage of the Lifeblood Refinement Realm. She had been in the Heavenly Note Sect for more than two years.
Jiang Hao was concerned to see that she was wearing the ring he gave her around her neck again. Fortunately, the ring looked like a necklace, so it didn’t look strange.
“Are the things ready?” Jiang Hao asked her.
“Yes. I have prepared everything they like to eat and put it in the storage treasure,” Xiao Li said.
Jiang Hao nodded and gave Cheng Chou some spirit stones and talismans.
After seeing them off, Jiang Hao sighed wearily. As time passed, Xiao Li’s parents grew older. There might come a day when she might not see them again. Every visit could turn out to be the last one.
When he returned to the courtyard, Jiang Hao saw a figure in a red and white dress crouching beside the Heavenly Fragrance Dao Flower.
He instinctively looked for the spirit beast. Sure enough, he saw it floating in the river.
“Greetings, Senior.” Jiang Hao respectfully greeted her.
“Are the Silver Moon Petals ready?” Hong Yuye stood up and asked..
