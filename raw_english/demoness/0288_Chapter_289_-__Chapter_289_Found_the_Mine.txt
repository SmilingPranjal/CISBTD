Chapter 289: Found the Mine
In the void, Jiang Hao saw countless lines around him.
They were extensions of the formation. These lines seemed simple but contained infinite power.
Upon closer observation, one would notice numerous interweaving runes among them. It was not something an ordinary person could comprehend.
Jiang Hao glanced at them briefly and ignored them.
Instead, he focused on the changes in the formation and slowly moved his body. Only by doing so could he smoothly enter the Blood Tide Forest.
At the same time, that summoning came once again. It seemed to urge him to give up on the Blood Tide Forest and follow wherever it wanted to lead him.
Jiang Hao turned around.
Based on his calculations, that place should be the Myriad Stone Forest.
It was the Golden Core region.
‘This has happened twice already. What is calling me?’ Jiang Hao was puzzled.
He could sense that this summoning originated from within himself and not from any magical treasure. But he chose to ignore it.
The Golden Core region was too dangerous. He’d better go to the Foundation Establishment region.
They could fight over opportunities there.
Everyone entered the Corpse Realm this time for opportunities. Even the people from the heavenly Joy Pavilion wouldn’t easily give up on opportunities, even if they wanted to avenge Senior Sister Yun Ruo.
Jiang Hao chose the Blood Tide Forest and quickly proceeded there. He didn’t care about the summoning.
No one had mentioned the summoning to him, so he didn’t understand what it actually was.
Jiang Hao arrived above the Blood Tide Forest. With one more selection, he would descend completely.
It seemed to open a stable passage for him to enter.
‘Such a treatment? It seems that this place is indeed unusual…’
Jiang Hao chose the Blood Tide Forest. Without hesitation, he entered the Foundation Establishment region.
He didn’t want to take unnecessary risks. He would follow his original plan.
If he wanted to walk a different path, he could do so after becoming invincible.
Whoosh!
The wind whistled past his ear and he landed on the ground, feeling a little dizzy.
What came into view was an extremely vast forest. There were open spaces and dangers here. And of course, there were opportunities!
Jiang Hao noticed three other people nearby. Two men and one woman.
Their attires were different from each other, but they appeared calm.
At a glance, it was clear that they were disciples of extraordinary sects.
However, he couldn’t guess which sect they belonged to.
According to Zhuang Yuzhen, the Corpse Realm Flowers were not limited to the Divine Corpse Sect.
Jiang Hao had asked before whether the Corpse Realm Flower could reproduce and increase in number, but the answer he received was negative. The flower turned back into a seed after maturing, and it waited to be planted once again.
There was no need to worry about the Corpse Realm Flower being stolen or destroyed because of this reason.
“All three of them are at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.” Jiang Hao silently observed the three individuals.
He carefully assessed them.
The woman seemed to be in her early twenties. One of the men looked calm and elegant, while the other appeared cold and indifferent. They all held spirit swords as their treasures. Most likely, they were from immortal sects.
“Late sage of the Foundation Establishment Realm?” The elegantly dressed man smiled at Jiang Hao. “Why don’t the four of us team up? You can help us with the dirty work. What do you think, everyone?” “I have no objections,” said the woman.
“What’s your value?” the cold and indifferent man asked.
Jiang Hao looked at the three of them but remained still. He noticed that tree that Zhuang Yuzhen had mentioned.
The Bloodthirsty Trees.
If one made any sudden moves, the tree would attack and devour them.
Jiang Hao wasn’t scared, but one misstep could reveal his cultivation realm to everyone. He didn’t want to cause any trouble.
“Your value?” The elegantly dressed man asked with a playful smile. “Why don’t you come over and test my value for yourself?”
No one else spoke.
The four of them stood silent and motionless. “I said, why don’t you come over and test my value?”
“Shut up! ”
The elegantly dressed man took the lead. “I’m Gu Wen. What about you guys?”
“Zhuge Zheng,” said the cold and indifferent man.
“Murong Qingqing,” said the woman.
Jiang Hao had no intention of mentioning his name. He planned to act alone anyway.
“What about you?” asked Gu Wen with a friendly smile.
“Jiang Hao.
“You can help us with the dirty work. The Blood Tide Forest has many spirit herbs, and these herbs need someone to take care of them after transplantation. You can be responsible for that. Your safety will be our responsibility during this time,” said Gu Wen.
Jiang Hao was speechless. ‘Take care of spirit herbs?’
After hesitating for a moment, he asked, “Is there a mine nearby? I still want to do some mining.”
The three of them were taken aback. It was their first time encountering someone like him.
“Are you from a small sect?” Murong Qingqing asked.
“That’s unlikely. He entered the Blood Tide Forest, and he is still standing. He shouldn’t be from a small sect,” said Gu Wen.
“The number of spots for entry is limited. They wouldn’t let a weak person in.” Zhuge Zheng looked at Jiang Hao.
Jiang Hao was surprised. These people were so wary of him. But he didn’t mind. He had told them the truth. He really wanted to do some mining.
“I do know a place where you can do some mining, but it doesn’t produce anything good. My senior has been mining there for half a year, and he only found some relatively rare ores,” Gu Wen said.
“Is the place safe? Is it suitable for planting spirit herbs?” Murong Qingqing asked.
“Compared to other places, it’s decent.” Gu Wen nodded.
“Then let’s go.” Zhuge Zheng looked at Jiang Hao. “He wants to mine, so let him mine.”
The current situation was turning out to be advantageous. In any case, he would let them lead the way for now.
“Let’s go. I’ll take you to see the mine.” Gu Wen led the way.
When it got dark, the Bloodthirsty Trees fell into a deep sleep. They would wake up again tomorrow.
However, these trees were not very common. After walking for a while, they noticed that the trees there were only ordinary Blood Tide Trees.
Jiang Hao walked at the very back of the line. The three in front didn’t seem to worry about him launching a surprise attack or escaping.
But he could sense that they were on their guard.
They could quickly counterattack if someone made a move. These people had excellent talents and strong vigilance. They were much stronger than Ye Shan and the others from the Ice Moon Valley.
‘They’re all disciples of major sects…’ Jiang Hao speculated.
Usually, once the Corpse Realm Flowers were discovered, they would be seized by major sects.
The Heavenly Note Sect existed because it was already a top-tier sect.
Moreover, all their items were snatched from other major sects.
Ordinary sects couldn’t do something like that.
There were major sects in the southern region, but they probably didn’t know about the flowers yet.
They walked for a day. During the journey, they encountered other people, but no one made a move.
Everyone had come for opportunities, and no one wanted to act out.
They also encountered some spirit herbs along the way, which were divided equally among the three people. Jiang Hao gained nothing.
“We’re here.”
In front of a pitch-black cave, Gu Wen pointed to the entrance. “The mine is right here. If you want to mine, go ahead. We’re not interested. But we’ll get our share of the harvest. And of course, you can have a share of the spirit herbs. You take care of the dirty work, and we won’t treat you unfairly.”
Jiang Hao frowned as he looked at the cave.
This mine made him feel a sense of danger..
