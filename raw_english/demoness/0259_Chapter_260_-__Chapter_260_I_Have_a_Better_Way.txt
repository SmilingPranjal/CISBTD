Chapter 260: I Have a Better Way
Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
‘The Heavenly Fate Misfortune Pearl has been discovered?’
Jiang Hao listened attentively. The Heavenly Fate Misfortune Pearl was still in his possession, so handing it over was out of the question.
Everyone said that the pearl was extremely terrifying, and once it broke free from its seal, it would bring about a catastrophic disaster.
Therefore, he could only continue to keep it hidden. However, now that others roughly knew its location, he worried that its exact whereabouts would be revealed.
At that time, everything would depend on whether the Heavenly Note Sect could withstand the attacks.
After Dan Yuan finished speaking, a stone tablet appeared in front of the four people.
Jiang Hao already understood that this was the sealing technique. He placed his hand on it. The technique was called the Seven-Stars Seal.
Using seven stars as anchor points, it connected to space and sealed the objects inside it.
The speed of sealing was fast, and the effect was powerful.
However, the duration of the seal was short. It only lasted seven days. It could be used up to seven times, sealing the item for forty-nine days.
“I created the sealing technique. So far, only five of us know about it. No one else does,” said Dan Yuan. “Please don’t share it with others for the time being.” Jiang Hao and the others nodded.
In other words, in the future, if they saw this sealing technique, it would be one of the five people who possessed it.
Once they received the sealing technique, the gathering continued.
Dan Yuan didn’t issue any more missions, and it was now time for them to talk among themselves.
Gui looked at Jiang Hao. “I have confirmed the sealed dragon. There are no issues. The curses are ready for you. Do you want it now?” Jiang Hao felt relieved. It meant he had passed her test.
He remained calm. “Yes, I want it now.”
Gui looked at Dan Yuan. A stone tablet appeared in front of the two of them.
Once Gui finished transmitting the information, Jiang Hao examined it.
Rather than trying to study its contents all at once, he simply wrote everything down and planned to study them more thoroughly later.
After double-checking and confirming that there was no problem, he withdrew his hand.
“I found three people. I have detained them, and they are a little injured.
However, they said there was a fourth person.”
“Alright. I’ll find a way to bring them to me. After that, our deal will be complete.” Xing nodded.
Liu nodded and then glanced at everyone. “Actually, I have been thinking if there is a better way to recultivate. I hope you can help me gather information in this regard. As for the reward, I can offer spirit stones, cultivation techniques, and information.”
“A better method?” said Jiang Hao. “I think I saw something about it in an old
book I found. Interestingly, this method also involves borrowing from the power of all things.”
“Borrowing power from all living things?” Liu looked at Jiang Hao. “Friend Jing, please go on.”
The others were also curious.
Gui had a strange feeling that Jing was being truthful. He might actually know of such a technique.
After witnessing the way he had sealed the dragon, she believed him.
Jiang Hao didn’t keep them waiting any longer. “Have you ever heard of a secret technique called Shifting Stars from the Bright Moon Sect?” he asked.
“Shifting Stars?” Liu looked at Xing.
Xing thought for a moment. “Indeed, I have heard of this secret technique, but
I remember it being a temporary method to enhance one’s own strength.”
“This secret technique needs to be used in conjunction with the Myriad Bodies Technique?” Gui was quite puzzled.
Jiang Hao shook his head. “I only saw it in the ancient book. I haven’t fully understood it yet…”
He turned to look at Dan Yuan. The others did the same.
“Indeed, it is possible. If it weren’t for Jing’s reminder, I wouldn’t even have thought about it.”
Liu was delighted. “Please enlighten us, Senior. In return, I will offer the promised reward.”
Dan Yuan nodded. “In order to use the Shifting Stars Technique, it requires a clone that can be incorporated into the body. It is best to use a portion of the Primordial Spirit as the foundation for the clone. Once the clone is successfully condensed, it can begin complete cultivation. When the cultivation foundation is solidified, the clone and the main body are merged, and the Shifting Stars Technique can be used to transfer the cultivation method. During this process, one’s cultivation will fluctuate, so it is best to experiment to reduce unexpected injuries. I wasn’t the one who proposed the technique, so I won’t claim the reward. However, I can provide the formation for half of the reward promised. If you have any further questions, you can ask me at any time. With this, the previous transaction is considered complete.”
“Thank you, Senior.” Jiang Hao accepted the formation, considering the trade complete.
Liu looked at Xing.
“Obtaining the Star Shifting Technique is not difficult, but it will take some time. As for the price, we don’t need to rush. Perhaps someone will show up overseas soon, and you can help me out,” Xing said.
“Alright.” Liu nodded and then looked at Jiang Hao. “Friend Jing, what do you need?”
Jiang Hao had only intended to create a mysterious and reliable persona of himself. He hadn’t intended on making a trade. However, he couldn’t refuse.
“I need some information about the End of All Things… Anything will do. Whether it’s about the sect or any hidden meanings behind it.”
“No problem.” Liu nodded.
After the trading session concluded, the group discussed various matters.
“The Bright Moon Sect has begun sending out invitations, inviting people from various sects to the conference. Some outstanding individuals can not only enter the sect but also obtain many treasures. It seems that the true geniuses of the Clear Sky School will also be attending this time.”
“I have heard about it as well. It is said that the Immortal Mansion may hold great opportunities. However, the situation overseas has not been peaceful lately. The sea is turbulent, and some people believe that hidden realms may appear in the deep sea.”
“I encountered people from the Divine Corpse Sect. Many of them are in the southern region. They are most likely heading to the Heavenly Note Sect.”
After the last gathering, everyone understood one thing: the powerful individual who had gone into the Heavenly Note Sect was from the Divine Corpse Sect.
Jiang Hao wanted to say something, but he didn’t.
He had been in the Heavenly Note Sect all this time, but he couldn’t reveal anything. It was better to be quiet.
After some time, Dan Yuan announced the end of the gathering.
Jiang Hao and the others left the public area.
Returning to his room, Jiang Hao immediately took out a notebook and began recording.
He wanted to write down the curse technique he had just obtained. He also wrote down everything he had found out about the Divine Corpse Sect and the End of All Things..
