Chapter 268: The Final Test
Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
Manlong’s actions surprised Jiang Hao.
It was strange that he had given up at the last moment. The benefits of a top disciple far exceeded that of a True Disciple.
Otherwise, Bai Ye wouldn’t have spent so much time and effort to become one of the ten disciples. Even so, Manlong had gone easy on him.
Jiang Hao almost hadn’t noticed.
Bai Ye’s spells were difficult to fathom, so it was tough to tell whether they were real or fake. He didn’t know if any of the masters of the twelve branches would be watching the fight.
If they sensed it, would they intervene? ‘I miscalculated.’ Jiang Hao sighed.
“He won?! ”
The audience was in disbelief.
“I think so.”
“Did you see how he managed to win?
“I don’t understand… Senior Brother Manlong kept getting injured, and then…”
“Senior Brother Bai Ye couldn’t get close to him. If he had gotten close, it would have been over for him. So, they kept trying to injure each other. In the end, it became a test of who could hold out longer.”
“Does this mean Bai Ye is going to become one of the top ten disciples?”
“Not yet… there’s still one last round.”
Jiang Hao looked into the distance.
Now that Bai Ye had defeated Manlong, there was only one last test left. If he passed that, he would be one of the top ten disciples.
The test wasn’t as difficult as defeating Manlong. He would probably pass that.
“Junior Brother Jiang, do you think that Bai Ye will become the tenth top disciple?” asked Liu Xingchen.
“It seems like it.”
Although he was unwilling to accept it, it was clear that Bai Ye had won.
However, Jiang Hao still had hope. If he could advance to the late stage of the Primordial Spirit Realm, he could still plan his revenge. It would just take longer than he had anticipated.
“I wonder which top disciple is coming to test him,” said Liu Xingchen.
At this moment, a figure descended from the sky.
It was a woman in a purple dress. She was tall and fair. Her hair was tied into a bun.
She landed in front of Bai Ye. “Congratulations on defeating Manlong, Junior Brother Bai Ye. Now, let me verify your qualifications. I will suppress my cultivation to the late stage of the Primordial Spirit Realm. I will only use one move. If you are standing upright even after that, you will have passed the test. ”
“That is the sixth top disciple, Senior Sister Wei Si, from the Heavenly Joy Pavilion!” said Liu Xingchen. “Usually, the one who tests a potential disciple would be from the first rank to the fifth.”
“So, will it be easier to pass?” Jiang Hao asked.
“It’s hard to say. For Bai Ye, in the late stage of the Primordial Spirit Realm, there’s no difference between the fifth and sixth disciples. They are equally formidable against him,” Liu Xingchen said.
Jiang Hao wasn’t very optimistic about the outcome. If it was just one move, Bai Ye could probably block it.
“Can we begin?” asked Wei Si as she suppressed her cultivation. Bai Ye took a deep breath and gathered all his power. “Yes, Senior Sister.”
Wei Si looked at Bai Ye. Her spiritual energy began to surge around her.
In an instant, she moved.
The surrounding spiritual energy flowed. It was as though everything around was under her control.
Everyone was confused. Wei Si seemed to have moved from her position, but it seemed as though she hadn’t at the same time.
She was already in front of Bai Ye.
Bai Ye was caught off guard. There was no time to react. Wei Si placed her hand on Bai Ye’s chest.
He doubled over and spat a mouthful of blood. He was sent flying backward after that.
With a thud, he fell to the ground. His blood spread on the ground.
Wei Si waited for Bai Ye to get up, but he couldn’t.
“Bai Ye, you have failed the test,” she said.
The crowd was in an uproar. Jiang Hao was in disbelief. He was still shocked by her palm strike. She had calmly placed her palm on Bai Ye’s chest, but all the surrounding spiritual energy seemed to respond to her.
Jiang Hao felt that even he couldn’t withstand such an attack. Wei Si had even suppressed her cultivation. He couldn’t imagine how strong she was at her peak.
Jiang Hao took a deep breath to calm himself. He didn’t need to hurry. He could become stronger than this.
However, Bai Ye’s failure made it look so unreal. He was defeated at the last moment.
Bai Ye still had the curse to deal with. All in all, Jiang Hao felt that the outcome had been good.
He could advance and confront him in a few months. He couldn’t kill him, of course. However, he would figure something out.
“He failed just like that?”
“Senior Brother Bai Ye failed… Does that mean Manlong is still the tenth top disciple?”
“Isn’t that unfair? Senior Brother Bai Ye already won the challenge. How is he expected to face a sixth top disciple at her full power?
“It’s fair. Bai Ye already had the home- ground advantage. This was his last test. ”
“The challenger had the home advantage. Isn’t that unfair to Senior Brother Manlong?”
“How is it unfair? Senior Brother Manlong has been the tenth top disciple for many years. He has accumulated so many resources. It looks unfair to me…”
Jiang Hao felt that it sounded reasonable. The top disciples had so many privileges. If a challenger couldn’t defeat a challenger despite having a home-ground advantage, then they didn’t really deserve to be a top disciple.
Manlong was more than qualified to be the tenth top disciple, but why had he gone easy on Bai Ye?
Maybe Bai Ye had made him an offer he couldn’t refuse.
Wei Si did not leave after that. Instead, she turned to look at Manlong.
“Bai Ye has failed to become one of the top ten disciples. However, Manlong was defeated by him. That was humiliating for all the top ten disciples. Manlong, you will be stripped of your title and banned from competing for the title of tenth top disciple for ten years.”
“Ten years?!” Manlong struggled to get up. “Why?”
Boom!
An invisible hand descended from the sky and slapped Manlong to the ground. Bones cracked. Manlong grimaced in pain.
“If ten years is a problem for you, let’s make it fifteen years,” said Wei Si calmly.
Manlong didn’t dare question her. Wei Si looked at everyone gathered.
“The challenge for the seat of tenth top disciple will begin in three years. Until then, the resources of the tenth place would be equally distributed among the nine others. If there is no one selected for the seat in the next three years, then the resources will be distributed to the strongest disciple in each realm category. There will be four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, four from Golden Core Realm and four from the Primordial Spirit Realm. We’ll do this in rotation until we finally find the tenth top disciple.”
She then flew up to the sky and disappeared.
Jiang Hao was a little surprised. The sixth top disciple seemed to have high authority.
Moreover, if the tenth top disciple wasn’t selected, the other nine would get a lot of extra resources. It was so difficult to make it to the tenth place since they seemed unwilling to include more people.
Ye Yaqing had said it was difficult for Bai Ye to succeed. It seemed to be true.
Even Manlong had been banned from competing for the title of the tenth top disciple for fifteen years!
As for the ordinary disciples, they had the chance to obtain the resources of the tenth top disciple after three years. They needed to become the strongest in their own cultivation realm.
Jiang Hao felt that he had a chance, but it was too flashy. He didn’t want to be noticed. He wanted to know what kind of resources were there before he decided to participate.
He had three years. There was no hurry.
Right now, he needed to focus on advancing to the late stage of the Primordial Spirit Realm..
