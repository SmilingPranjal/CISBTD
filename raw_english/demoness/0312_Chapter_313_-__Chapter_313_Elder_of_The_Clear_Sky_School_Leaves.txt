Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
At midnight, Jiang Hao concealed himself and then took out a stone tablet to access the public platform.
After half a year, he could finally hear news from the outside world again. However, he hadn’t encountered Hong Yuye. He couldn’t get her opinion on anything.
Fortunately, he didn’t return empty-handed.
Setting aside the matter of the Heavenly Fragrance Dao Flower, Dan Yuan gave him two tasks.
The first task was to find the Heavenly Stele Mountain and comprehend the
SIXtn stone taD1et.
Second, get the list of people searching for the Heavenly Fate Misfortune Pearl.
Jiang Hao couldn’t complete the first task, but he had already finished the second one.
The Heavenly King Hai Luo had given him the list, which he memorized and returned to him.
It was useful in some ways, but as for the reward, he hadnt thought about it yet.
After a short while, he arrived at the public area.
It was still the same location as before, with the same people.
As soon as he arrived, he felt Gui glancing at him. This puzzled him.
When he turned to look, he found Gui smiling faintly at him.
Jiang Hao remained calm and composed.
Since he wanted to establish a mysterious, aloof, and powerful impression, he needed to remain unfazed even if Mount Tai collapsed before him.
Once everyone gathered, they began paying respects to Senior Dan Yuan.
“Do any of you have any cultivation problems?” Senior Dan Yuan looked at the crowd.
No one spoke up.
After all, it had only been half a year. They hadn’t had much time to cultivate.
“Since there are none, let’s talk about the previous tasks.” Senior Dan Yuan looked at the group. “Any news about the Heavenly Fragrance Dao Flower?”
Everyone shook their heads. This was the most difficult task to accomplish.
Gui was the most likely to complete it since she was the closest to it.
“What about the Heavenly Stele Mountain?” Senior Dan Yuan looked at Gui.
Everyone knew she had entered the Corpse Realm.
“Half completed,” Gui said with a smile.
“It seems that Gui is destined to succeed this time.” Liu chuckled.
“Normally, that would be the case, but it’s not necessarily true.” Gui turned to look at Jiang Hao. “I wonder if someone will seize it before me.”
As Jiang Hao felt Gui’s gaze on him, his face remained unchanged. But he could barely mask his surprise.
Was she testing him, or was it something else?
How did she know that he had entered the Corpse Realm?
Jiang Hao’s mind raced. Finally, he realized that he had used Universe in a Palm ability.
He had used that on the dragon that Gui was looking for before. Then, he used it again to send Shang An out of the Corpse Realm.
Since the Human Yuan had fluctuated rapidly, it was bound to be noticed.
‘I need to be more careful while using Universe in a Palm. Fortunately, the
Charm Goddess disappeared. Otherwise, there would be trouble.’
Jiang Hao couldn’t help but sigh. He regretted interfering in other people’s business. He had to be more cautious.
Of course, as long as the Charming God didn’t meet Gui, there wouldn’t be any issues.
At this moment, the others also looked over. They were surprised at Gui’s words.
They could guess that Jing had also entered the Corpse Realm from her words. It was indeed surprising.
“I’ve been a bit busy lately,” Jiang Hao said nonchalantly.
He neither admitted nor denied it.
Senior Dan Yuan nodded and then talked about the matter of the list. Liu was indeed someone who had connections overseas. Soon, he mentioned a few names.
Liu was indeed someone who had connections overseas. Soon, he mentioned a few names.
Half of them were on the list from the Heavenly King Hai Luo. However, the last two names were unfamiliar.
“I’ve heard that an overseas expert named Mu Qiu is also pursuing the Heavenly Fate Misfortune Pearl,” said Jiang Hao slowly.
“Mu Qiu?” Liu was quite surprised. “The Mu Qiu from the Great Thousand God Sect?”
Jiang Hao didn’t respond. In fact, he only knew the name but not the person.
After all, why would the Heavenly King give him those two words?
“We need to confirm it. I will provide an answer at the next gathering,” Dan Yuan said.
Jiang Hao and Liu nodded.
Since there were no new tasks, the gathering moved on to the next topic.
“Jing, do you have any news about Gu Qing?” Xing inquired.
Jiang Hao shook his head.
Since Gui had already said he was in the Corpse Realm, it was understandable that he had no news about Gu Qing.
“How can we make a woman willingly hand over something?” Gui suddenly asked.
“Shouldn’t you ask yourself about that? You’re a woman,” said Liu.
“It’s different.” Gui shook her head. “Every person has a different personality, so the approach will certainly be different.”
Jiang Hao thought of the Charm Goddess. She was very skilled at persuading people, especially men.
They discussed it for a while but couldn’t come up with a solution.
After that, they started sharing their own experiences.
“There’s an extraordinary genius that appeared in the Corpse Realm, and I’ve been wanting to see who it is,” said Gui.
“A genius?” Dan Yuan was also curious.
Geniuses were common when it came to the cultivation world. But extraordinary geniuses were rare.
“How much of a genius are they?” Xing was curious too.
“I don’t know. I only know that Heavenly Stele Mountain has been trying to summon that person. However, the person hasn’t responded,” said Gui.
“The Heavenly Stele Mountain summoned them?” Liu was surprised. “That’s unbelievable…”
“Indeed, it is. After all, most of those who enter the Corpse Realm are geniuses, yet such summoning has only happened twice. The first time was probably one or two hundred years ago, and nothing like that has been heard of since,” Gui said.
Jiang Hao was shocked.
If he wasn’t mistaken, he had been summoned a few times too, and he had ignored it each time.
Could it be that the Heavenly Stele Mountain had summoned him?
He needed to be careful. If his identity was exposed, the danger would undoubtedly follow. He must never go to the Heavenly Stele Mountain.
As for being an extraordinary genius…
He knew that he wasn’t one at all. He had only achieved success by relying on external things like spirit herbs and divine items.
“Maybe the Heavenly Stele Mountain can also make mistakes,” said Xing.
“There are no Corpse Realm Flowers in the east. Otherwise, the Bright Moon
Sect and the Clear Sky School would also send their best disciples to the Corpse Realm.”
Jiang Hao was speechless.
“Oh, speaking of the Clear Sky School, I heard something interesting,” Xing said. “Some time ago, I heard that a demonic sect cultivator requested to meet an elder of the Clear School Sky. However, his status was not enough, and his strength was no match for the Clear Sky School. He couldn’t even enter the main gate. Then I don’t know what happened, but he actually tried to force his way into the sect. He was suppressed. At that time, he roared angrily at the Clear School Sect, saying he had something important to say and that the sect would regret it if they didn’t listen.”
“And then?” Gui was very curious.
Xing smiled. “Such remarks are quite common. It did nothing to catch the Clear Sky School’s attention. But just a few days ago, an elder who had been out returned and was interested. She met with the cultivator. Interestingly, just a few days after, the elder had broken through the void, traversed space, and left the Clear Sky School. The entire sect had no idea what happened. They wanted to know what the cultivator had said to her. However, that cultivator was taken away, and they had no way of finding out..”
